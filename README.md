# Euro Art Museum

The Euro Art Museum is a Virtual Reality App developed in Unity using C#.

<B>Project</B>

The goal of this project is to present different art periods from Europe to the user through music, architecture, paintings and some sculptures. For this purpose I used only waypoints for movement, so the user stands in strategical points of the museum.

I am continually iterating the project. The main problem I am having is the placement of the waypoints in a comfortable way along with the placement of the artwork. Another problem is with the GVR Reticle, which sometimes disappear in the way.

I intend to develop more of this work and possibly make bigger rooms for each art period and include the Reinassance. There are two early videos of the project in the Screenshots folder and I will make more soon.
